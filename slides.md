## What is a "Reef Report Card"?

2009 - Reef Water Quality Protection Plan

*Long term goal*: 
> To ensure that by 2020 the quality of water entering the reef from broadscale land use has no detrimental impact on the health and resilience of the Great Barrier Reef.

Water quality and land management targets to meet that goal.

Report cards measure progress towards those targets.
