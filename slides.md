## Why automate?

 - Produce reports faster

 - Reduce data-entry errors

---

## Our work so far

 * Focusing on Excel spreadsheets, not machine-focused formats
   * Chart generation & data extraction from those formats
 * Client-focused
   * Incremental improvement on existing workflow
   * Constraints - "What can we easily do in their environment?"
