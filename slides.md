## What is a “Reef Report Card”?

<p style="font-size: 10em">?</p>


### 2009 - Reef Water Quality Protection Plan

*Long term goal*: 
> To ensure that by 2020 the quality of water entering the reef from
broadscale land use has no detrimental impact on the health and resilience of
the Great Barrier Reef.


### Reef Plan

Sets water quality and land management targets required to meet the long-term
goal.

### Reef Report Card

Reports on progress towards those targets, using measurements taken on a 
(mostly) annual basis.

## Why automate?

 - Produce reports faster

 - Reduce data-entry errors

## Our work so far


### Data Input Formats

Excel spreadsheets, not machine-friendly XML

Chart generation & data extraction from those formats

### Not another workflow system

System assists the process, rather than changing it.

### Constraints 

What can we easily do in their environment?
